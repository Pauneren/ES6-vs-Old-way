# ES6-vs-Old-way
comparison between the new and old javascript
I made folder with 2 separate files , one has the old javascript method and the other the ES6 , both work, I used the list of a past exercise to output values and also made a new array to work with it. The comments are inside the code.
I use Babel to transpile the Es6 to old javascript
